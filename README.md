# zimbrapowershellclasses
PowerShell 5.x Class file for easily adding Zimbra user and resource management functionality to your own PowerShell scripts. This is not a cmdlet but a reusable set of Classes to incorporate in your own scripts.
I needed to write this Zimbra script to be part of the User provisioning scripts.
PowerShell 5.0 introduced ability to use real Classes, strongly typed properties and method returns.
